Introduction

The education sector seems to be reinventing itself so quickly, adopting technology for course 
delivery and support functions. Since the proposed solutions cover the area of student performance 
management, Our website is designed to ensure the enhancement of performance by increasing 
the effectiveness and decreasing the number of errors made by the students.
The Student Progress Tracking System(SPTS) is a specialized web application tracking student 
performance. This system focuses on generating student progress reports, updating marks, 
calculating GPA and suggesting suitable subjects based on student performance. Not only that but 
also, This system is intended to be used by the administrators and students so that they may update 
records and performance information in academic records. In addition to that, This site facilitates 
communication which means students can communicate with each other and it helps to solve their 
problems.

Background

Over the past few years, digital technologies have become integrated into the landscape of 
Universities for supervising different processes within the Institutions, Despite this, many 
Universities still rely on manual processes for critical administrative functions such as grade 
management, GPA calculation and academic advising. These are some of the processes that can 
take a lot of time to complete, and are also inaccurate; this can have various implications for the 
students and or the administrators.
The SPTS Project was conceived to address these challenges by creating a specialized tool that 
automates these administrative tasks. The System will also indirectly serve students because it will 
allow for the effective scale-up and automation of all these types of tasks, so that students have 
access to accurate, real-time academic information. The system will be suitable for university
students to enhance their academic journey.
This is not a Traditional LMS. our LMS aims to enhance the learning experience through 
innovative features. Unlike traditional Learning Management System, SPTS focuses only on 
Student performance tracking, without providing educational resources. because the Traditional 
LMS Provides educational resources but they did not provide any kind of reports to measure the 
progress of the student. In our system, we mainly focus on improving the productivity of both 
students and the Lecturer.

Problem statement

Universities often struggle with efficiently managing and updating student marks, accurately 
calculating GPA, and providing appropriate subject recommendations. The present methods used 
include manual ones or systems that are not optimally designed for these purposes and as such 
several inefficiencies emerge that disadvantage students and administrators.
Due to the use of paper-based operations or generic software applications that are not suited for 
such functions various issues arise such as; poor working efficiency, inaccuracies, and slow 
information delivery. These issues impact both administrators as these staff are bogged down with 
these tasks and students as they are likely to receive decisions about their academic progress that 
are flawed or delivered much later than needed.
Not only that but also, but We have also experienced some flaws in the current Learning 
Management System of our university. These sites couldn’t help to enhance student productivity 
because they only view the grades and provide resources such as “MYOUSL” and “OULMS”.

Project objectives

• Develop a web-based application that allows administrators to update student marks and 
automatically calculate GPA. thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of students.
• Implement a feature that suggests suitable subjects for students based on their academic 
performance, helping them make informed decisions about their course selections.
• Enhance Data Security and privacy, which means ensuring the student data is protected from 
unauthorized access.
• We aim to ensure Scalability and performance which means we design the system architecture 
to handle increasing amounts of data and users without compromising performance testing.
• Provide Notifications, Emails and progress reports to enhance student progress.

Introduction to Similar Types of Systems

Several systems exist that provide comprehensive Learning Management System(LMS) 
functionalities, However, they may contain all sorts of functionalities that can cover content 
delivery or management, student engagement tools and resources among others that are not generic 
to or encompass Student progress management. Examples of similar systems include:
• Moodle - An open-source LMS that supports a wide range of educational activities but is 
primarily focused on course delivery and resource management.
• Udemy - This site provides educational resources and full courses for self-study to students 
and is mainly focused on improving the knowledge of the students.
• OpenLearn - This site is maintained by Open University and it provides Learning 
materials, Day schools, and academic guidelines only.
• Google Classroom - A free web-based platform developed by Google for schools. It 
simplifies creating, distributing, and grading assignments.
• DP Education - This website helps self-study students by holding classes and providing 
resources.
• Schoology - A widely used LMS that combines assessments and collaboration features 
into one comprehensive platform.
• Edmodo - A social learning platform for K-12 education that offers tools for teachers to 
share content, distribute quizzes, and manage communication with students and parents.
• TalentLMS - A cloud-based LMS designed for corporate training and development but 
also suitable for Universities.
• LearnDash - A WordPress LMS plugin that allows users to create and manage online 
courses within their WordPress website
• Teachable - An LMS focused on enabling instructors and institutions to create and sell 
online courses.
SPTS mainly focuses on concentrating on student progress management and providing efficient 
tools for academic administration. That means, our system will help to enhance the student’s 
academic journey.

Proposed solution
Traditional LMS does not measure the student's progress, calculate the GPA value, provide a 
progress report about the student, etc. As a solution to this problem, we are creating this web 
application to make the academic journey successful for both the student and the lecturer. Here 
automatic GPA calculation for students, Recommending subjects related to the next year based on 
the results of the current academic year, a progress report, Provide Activity schedule, and Educate 
about upcoming activities via notifications and emails, The lecturer can provide feedback on 
student progress and outcomes of each activity and Student can use group chat option to 
communicate with each other and that option helps to solve the doubts of any subject. As our web 
application uses methods such as automatic GPA calculation for students, these values can be 
easily calculated automatically through our web application, saving the time wasted in manual 
calculations, accuracy, and reliability. Our web application can be described as an effective 
solution designed for such shortcomings in traditional LMS. Efficiently tracking and managing 
student progress is crucial for Universities, as it directly impacts the quality of education and 
administrative efficiency. In this context, the Student Progress Tracking System(SPTS) emerges 
as a specialized tool designed to streamline academic tasks.
Importance and Relevance
• Efficiency - Traditional methods of managing student marks and calculating GPA are 
often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. By automating these processes, SPTS 
significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy.
• Accuracy - Accurate tracking of student performance data is essential for making 
informed decisions about academic progress and interventions. SPTS ensures reliable data 
management and timely updates.
• Support for Decision-making - With features like subject recommendations based on 
academic performance, SPTS assists students in making informed decisions about their 
educational pathways, potentially leading to better academic outcomes.
Scope of the Project
The SPMS project focuses on the following key functionalities:
• Updating Marks - A user-friendly interface for administrators to update student marks.
• Progress Reports - Automated generation of detailed student progress reports.
• GPA Calculation - Accurate and real-time GPA calculations based on updated marks.
• Subject Recommendations - Personalized subject suggestions for students based on their 
academic performance data.
